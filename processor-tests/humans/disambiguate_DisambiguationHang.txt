Updating all three is correct here, at least on the current
processor design. The logic is not simple.

Disambiguation is based on the subsequent form. In this test case,
the value of et-al-subsequent-min is 3. In the first two insertions,
the Burnod cites come out with one name only, because the list
of names is 3 or greater in length, and adding names contributes
nothing to disambiguation.

When the Urban cite is inserted, the internal parameters are
correctly adjusted to 3 for the first two cites, and that difference
triggers tainting, hence all three cites are queued for updating.

This is not entirely optimal, because in the *rendered* form,
all three insertions will result in five names on the Burnod
cites. However, controlling the redundant update in this case
would require that we code position context adjustments into
the disambiguation module. That is not practicable because
the et-al parameters may vary between name nodes in the CSL.

A clean and precise solution to this is possible, but it doesn't
seem to be worth the candle.
