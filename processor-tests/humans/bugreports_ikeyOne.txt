  I believe that the full name is correct here. With by-cite
  disambiguation, an uncited item in the bibliography that would clash
  with a cite in the document should trigger disambiguation. That's my
  call on this one, anyway.

  Well, that would have been true if this test resulted in an uncited
  item. But the third operation deletes the initial citation completely.
  The orginal test result "Smith" is correct here.
