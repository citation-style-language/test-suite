In Zotero 2.1a1.SVN, a multiple-cite citation fails to create when it is
in first position.  But the test below runs successfully.  Something is
amiss, but it doesn't seem to be inside the processor (or at least not
only inside the processor.)

Aha.  Simon's bug report to the citeproc-js group makes it clear.
Apparently the problem lies elsewhere; references no longer needed
are not being deleted from the bib, and updateItems() doesn't play
nice as a way of forcing an update.  That's another test.
