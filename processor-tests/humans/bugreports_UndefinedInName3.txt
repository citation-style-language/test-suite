Bug report by Carles Pina.

## 2013-04-17 :: Frank Bennett <biercenator@gmail.com>

  At the time of reporting, the target style had no
  "givenname-disambiguation-rule" set (and MHRA still does not). The
  specification was subsequently revised to required "by-cite"
  disambiguation. Under by-cite disambiguation, the subsequent form in
  the style is "Kim and Kim", without the given names.

>>===== RESULT =====>>
B-X Kim and A-Y Kim.
Kim and Kim, 23.
