The first item begins with a valid French language tag, followed by
garbage. The second begins with a valid English tag followed by
garbage. The third begins with garbage. The behaviour in the RESULT
reflects the CSL 1.0.1 specification, which in the Title Case
Conversion section reads:

  "If default-locale is set to a locale code with a primary language
  tag other than "en", items are assumed to be non-English. An item is
  only considered to be English if the value of its language field
  starts with the "en" primary language tag."

In the style used in this test, no locale is set, so the default is
"en". When the language tag parse fails, "en" is assumed.

By agreement within CSL circles, garbage should be construed as
"non-English content" for purposes of applying text-case rules. This
is not happy, since without specifics we cannot know which cite format
to apply to the item. To keep things simple in citeproc-js, we set the
language for garbage to "tlh", for Klingon, which is about as
non-English as you can get.
